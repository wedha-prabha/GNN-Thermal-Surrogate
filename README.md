# 🚀 GNN SURROGATE MODEL FOR TURBINE BLADE FILM COOLING

## Project Title: Real-Time High-Fidelity Thermal Prediction via Graph Attention Networks (GNN)

### 🎯 Goal
To develop a high-performance Machine Learning surrogate model that can predict the **Film Cooling Effectiveness ($\eta$)**—the 2D/3D temperature distribution—on a gas turbine blade surface in **real-time** (milliseconds), bypassing complex, time-consuming Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations (which typically take hours).

### 🛠️ Key Technologies
* **Mechanical Domain:** Fluid Dynamics / Heat Transfer (Turbine Blade Film Cooling)
* **ML Architecture:** **Graph Attention Network (GATv2Conv)** using PyTorch Geometric (PyG).
* **Performance:** Achieved optimization through **Mixed Precision Training (AMP)**.
* **User Interface (UI):** **Streamlit** for an interactive, web-based demonstration.
